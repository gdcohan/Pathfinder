OVERVIEW:

The program takes a graph and enables the user to either find the shortest distance between two nodes or 
find the minimum spanning tree of the graph. It does the first using Dijkstra's algorithm and the second
using Kruskal's algorithm.

The graph must be in a file and have the following format:

USA.bmp
NODES
WashingtonDC 5.71 2.25
Minneapolis 3.76 2.93
SanFrancisco 0.278 2.31
Dallas 3.31 1.04
KansasCity 3.56 2.08
ARCS
Minneapolis SanFrancisco 1777
Minneapolis Dallas 935
Minneapolis WashingtonDC 1600
SanFrancisco WashingtonDC 2200
Dallas SanFrancisco 1540 
Dallas WashingtonDC 1319
Minneapolis KansasCity 380


In this format, the first line is an image, followed by "NODES", the cities, "ARCS", and the connetions.

This projects was done as an assignment for a class called Stanford 106B that I found the material for online.
As such, it uses a few classes and methods provided by the class. These classes are mainly container classes that
model sets, vectors, stacks, etc. They also provided some built in graphics support. All of the support files
are in the project folder.

Known Bugs:
1) Currently, the program is set up to run until the user decides to quit. However, if you try to load a second
graph file without restarting the program, the image of the graph does not appear correctly in the graphics window.

2) Currently, the program can only parse graph files where the distance between two nodes (arcs) is an integer.
